   - Encourage satisfied subscribers to share your content on X.

7. Promotional Offers:
   - Run occasional promotions (e.g., first month free, annual subscription discount) and promote them through your X posts.

8. Collaborate with Influencers:
   - Reach out to influential researchers or science communicators for potential collaborations or guest curation of your daily top papers.

9. Highlight Unique Features:

10. Educational Content:
    - Share tips on how to stay up-to-date with scientific literature or how to efficiently read research papers.

Remember to stay consistent with your posting and engagement strategy. Building a large following takes time, but with persistent effort and valuable content, you can grow your newsletter subscriber base significantly.
