i make different posts for my different prodcuts/pages i have

# newsletter

## biorxiv

- [x] https://www.reddit.com/r/labrats/comments/8rgngm/thoughts_on_publishing_in_biorxiv/ - focus on advertising biorxiv
- [x] https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/1f37icg/
linking_to_published_article_on_biorxiv_preprint/ - posting for biorxiv 
- [x] https://www.reddit.com/r/biology/ - bioarxiv 
- [ ] https://www.reddit.com/r/biotech/
- [ ] https://www.reddit.com/r/APbio/

## trending ai papers

i can come back tomorrow and post another three posts i guess. tomorrow i can try to make advertisement for the newsletter in the bio related channels 


- r/MachineLearning - 
- https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/ - 
- https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/ - 
- https://www.reddit.com/r/datasciencenews/ --> admin first needs to confirm access request
- https://www.reddit.com/r/deeplearning/ 
- https://www.reddit.com/r/arxiv/
- https://www.reddit.com/r/PhD/
- https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/ --> only can post if its open source
https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/ --> tried but i need at least 10 comment karma

### notes 

lets just start posting in the subreddits i want to post in

I built a web app to track trending AI papers using Mendeley reader counts

its possible to select between time periods 1w, 1m, 3m, 6m, 1y and all time and you can filter for greatest which will show the paper with the most mendeley reader couints for this time period first or you can filter for trending which will show you the papers first which gained the most mendeley reader counts first.

the backend is entirely written in python, happy to dig into more details, would love to open source if i find time for it.


I built a web app to track trending AI papers using Mendeley reader counts

Hey everyone!

I've created a web app that helps researchers and AI interested folks stay on top of the most impactful arXiv AI papers. Here's what it does:

Key Features:
- Tracks papers based on Mendeley reader counts
- Customizable time periods: 1w, 1m, 3m, 6m, 1y, and all-time
- Two viewing modes: 
  1. "Greatest" - shows papers with the highest total reader counts
  2. "Trending" - highlights papers gaining readers the fastest

I'm also considering open-sourcing the project when I have more time.

Questions for the community:
1. Would you find this tool useful for your research or studies?
2. Any features you'd like to see added?
3. Anyone interested in contributing if I open-source it?

## article for labrats subreddit 

i made a newsletter for biorxiv papers. you basically can choose up to 3 biorxiv categories or all articles and then it will send you every day 3 papers summarized by AI and the first page of the paper pdf is shown together with highlights in it highlightes.

the three papers are send to you based on the categories you have chosen and selected based on how trending they are which is counted on how often they were mentioned on twitter. the papers from the last 7 days are respected for this.

spoiler the newsletter is for 5 bucks a month but i have to pay the AI for the summaries. if you scroll down on the website you can choose between arxiv and bioarxiv, you need to click on bioarxiv for subscribing to bioarxiv papers. the website is https://newsletter.pantheon.so


I built an AI powered newsletter for trending bioRxiv papers

Hey all!

I've developed a newsletter service that helps researchers stay up to date with the latest bioRxiv preprints. 

Key Features:
- Choose up to 3 bioRxiv categories (or all articles)
- Receive 3 trending papers daily, summarized by AI
- View the first page of each paper PDF with highlights
- Papers are selected based on Twitter mentions in the last 7 days

I'm looking for feedback to improve the service. You can check it out at https://newsletter.pantheon.so (scroll down and click on bioRxiv).

Questions for the community:
1. Would this be useful for your research or studies?
2. Any features you'd like to see added?
3. Thoughts on the AI summarization approach?

Full disclosure: The service costs $5/month to cover AI summarization costs and to make the product better. There's also an arXiv version available.

I'm excited to hear your thoughts and suggestions!
