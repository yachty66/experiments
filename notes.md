I have an X account that posts every day the 10 most trending papers in the following format:

üè∑Ô∏è:GLOV: Guided Large Language Models as Implicit Optimizers for Vision Language Models

üîó:https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.06154.pdf
---

Together with an image that contains a summary of the paper as bullet points. We almost have 6k followers. We also launched a website where people can choose up to 3 topics from all topics on arXiv, and we have also added bioRxiv. If they select up to three categories, they receive the three most trending papers from the categories they selected every day. Each paper comes with an even more comprehensive summary and the first page of the PDF from the paper with the highlights highlighted in the paper. The cost is $5 per month.

We have 10 paying users. My goal now is to grow the newsletter to thousands of users. I want to make one post on Twitter every day to advertise the newsletter, and I want to make 50 replies per day.

Can you please help me come up with a strategy for this?
